Dear Earl:

On behalf of all the 500+ members of BSUG, we’d like to thank you for
your service and contributions over these past five years in organizing
and sustaining our Building Simulation User’s Group.

Since April of 2006, when we held our first BSUG forum, your commitment
to this professional development organization has been constant and
determined. Not only did you initiate the creation of this body, but it
has only been through your leadership and guidance these past five years
that BSUG has grown and thrived.

Your legacy is to leave the energy analysis community in Oregon wiser,
better informed, and more capable than perhaps any other group of energy
analysts in the country.

With sincere thanks,
